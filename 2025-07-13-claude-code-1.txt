     # Things MCP Server
     A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that interfaces with the Mac application "Things" (by Cultured Code) through its URL scheme. This enables AI
     assistants and other applications to interact with Things for task management operations.
     ## Overview
     This MCP server allows you to control the Things app on macOS through standardized MCP protocol commands. The first iteration implements basic navigation
      functionality, with plans to expand to full task management capabilities.
